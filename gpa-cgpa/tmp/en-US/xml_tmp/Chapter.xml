		The User Guide is authored to help the end-user<footnote><para>An end user of a computer system or software is someone who uses it.</para></footnote> and the reader community to use the piece of the GPA-CGPA calculator. The user guide is simple to read with the help of the table of contents or even with the index in the guide. The preliminary research shows that one of thousand students are using the calculator to measure the GPA and CGPA.
		</para>
		<para>
		The User Guide is being detailed with appropriate images. This includes the necessary layout, and the actual content. The first chapter is based on the brief of the GPA and CGPA literature. The readers will enjoy while they are going through the chapter. That chapter not only helps the user of the application to know about their WH but also use the content while they are talking about the program. The Second Chapter will help the user to familiar with the actual process to use the software<footnote><para>Computer software, or just software, is any set of machine-readable instructions that directs a computer’s processor to perform specific operations. The term is used to contrast with computer hardware, the physical objects (processor and related devices) that carry out the instructions.

The last but the least chapter is the source of the author and the debug<footnote><para>Debugging is a methodical process of finding and reducing the number of bugs, or defects, in a computer program or a piece of electronic hardware, thus making it behave as expected. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.</para></footnote> information.

		<para>
		Grading in education is the process of applying standardized measurements of varying levels of achievement in a course.
		</para>

		<para>
		Grades<footnote><para>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade</para></footnote> can be assigned in letters (for example A, B, C, D, E or F), as a range (for example 1 to 6), as a percentage of a total number correct, as a number out of a possible total (for example out of 20 or 100), or as descriptors (excellent, great, satisfactory, needs improvement).
		</para>

		<para>
In some countries, all grades from all current classes are averaged to create a grade point average (GPA) for the marking period. The GPA is calculated by taking the number of grade points a student earned in a given period of time divided by the total number of credits taken<footnote><para>Grade Point Average,(n), Retrieved November 25, 2013, http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grade</para></footnote>.The GPA can be used by potential employers or educational institutions to assess and compare applicants. A Cumulative Grade Point Average is a calculation of the average of all student’s grades for all courses completed so far.
		</para>

		<para>
Grades in courses are based on the instructor’s judgment<footnote><para>Judgment is the cognitive process of reaching a decision or drawing conclusions.</para></footnote> of a student’s achievement. Students who dispute a grade should follow grade mediation and adjudication procedures.

                         </indexterm>
		</para>

		<para>
Semester/session grade-point average and cumulative grade-point average are calculated to represent numerically a student’s quality of performance. These averages are used to determine if a student qualifies for certain academic actions (e.g., Dean’s List, academic warning/drop, entrance to and changes in college/major, and graduation) and programs (e.g., student aid and study abroad).

		Yale University historian George W. Pierson writes "According to tradition the first grades issued at Yale (and possibly the first in the country) were given out in the year 1785, when President Ezra Stiles, after examining 58 Seniors, recorded in his diary that there were ’Twenty Optimi, sixteen second Optimi, twelve Inferiores (Boni), ten Pejores <footnote><para> Pierson, George (1983). New Haven: Yale Office of Institutional Research A Yale Book of Numbers. p. 310.</para></footnote>'" Keith Hoskin argues that the concept of grading students’ work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named William Farish and first implemented by the University of Cambridge in 1792<footnote><para> Postman, Neil (1992). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 13.</para></footnote>. Hoskin’s assertion has been questioned by Christopher Stray, who finds the evidence for Farish as the inventor of the numerical mark to be unpersuasive<footnote><para> Christopher Stray, "From Oral to Written Examinations: Cambridge, Oxford and Dublin 1700 to 1914", History of Universities 20:2 (2005), 94,95.</para></footnote>. Stray’s article elucidates the complex relationship between the mode of examination (testing), in this case oral or written, and the varying philosophies of education these modes imply, both to teacher and student. As a technology, grading both shapes and reflects many fundamental areas of educational theory and practice.

				<para>
				A student’s cumulative grade-point average is the weighted mean value of all grade points he/she earned by enrollment in university courses. Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) refers to the overall GPA, which includes dividing the number of quality points earned in all courses attempted by the total degree-credit hours
in all attempted courses.

				The semester or term GPA is your Grade Point Average for that one term or semester. The Cumulative GPA is you grade point average for all attempted courses in the program.
